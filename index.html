			You do not have to be good.<br>
			You do not have to walk on your knees<br>
			for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.<br>
			You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>
			love what it loves.<br>
			Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br>
			Meanwhile the world goes on.<br>
			Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br>
			are moving across the landscapes,<br>
			over the prairies and the deep trees,<br>
			the mountains and the rivers.<br>
			Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br>
			are heading home again.<br>
			Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br>
			the world offers itself to your imagination,<br>
			calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting<br>
			over and over announcing your place<br>
			in the family of things.
